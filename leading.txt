...Snake game...

>>The "head" of the snake continually moves forward,
unable to stop, growing ever longer. It must be
steered left, right, up, and down to avoid hitting
walls and the body of either snake. The player who
survives the longest wins. Single-player versions are
less prevalent and have one or more snakes controlled
by the computer, as in the light cycles segment of the
1982 Tron arcade game.

>>Save you Polzun and make him happy with the
longest tail.

>>Avoid enemy snake, your body
and end of massive(pole)

>>Angry snake enemy dont want to be your
snake friend
