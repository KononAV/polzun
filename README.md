## *The first fully completed game made with Python + Tkinter*

This is my first fully completed game built with Python and the Tkinter GUI toolkit.
All UI elements are created entirely with text and dynamic transitions, utilizing pure Tkinter features — no external libraries.

## *Screenshots*

Interface created in **digital-minimalism** style.

## *Gameplay*

Classic **Snake** mechanics — minimalistic, responsive, and fun to play.

- **Objective:** Eat food to grow the snake and score points.
- **Controls:** Use arrow keys (`↑ ↓ ← →`) to change direction.
- **Speed scaling:** Game gradually speeds up as your score increases.
- **Obstacles:** Avoid hitting walls or your own tail.
- **Game Over:** Collision with wall or self ends the game.
- **Restart system:** Quick restart available after game over.
- **No external libraries:** Built entirely with `tkinter` and Python standard tools.
